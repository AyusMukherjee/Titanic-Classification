# Titanic-Classification
Making a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.

It involves building a machine learning model to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. This project is a classic example of binary classification in data science. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach such a project:

Understanding the Problem:

Gain a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. In this case, it's predicting whether a passenger survived or not based on various attributes.

Gather and Explore the Data:

Obtain the Titanic dataset, which typically contains information about passengers such as name, age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and basic statistics.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values by imputing or removing them.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones if necessary.

Data Visualization:

Visualize the data to gain insights into relationships between variables, survival rates by different factors, and other patterns. Tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be helpful for this.

Split the Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Select a Machine Learning Algorithm:

Choose a suitable classification algorithm. Common choices for this type of problem include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting models.

Model Training:

Train your chosen model on the training dataset. Tune hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the testing dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure its performance.

Model Interpretation:

If applicable, interpret the model's results to understand which features are most important for predicting survival.

Model Deployment (Optional):

If you want to deploy the model for real-world use, create an application or web service to make predictions.

Documentation and Reporting:

Create a report or presentation summarizing your findings, the model's performance, and any insights gained.

Iterate and Improve:

Iterate on your model and data preprocessing steps to improve its performance if necessary.

Finalize and Present:

Once you're satisfied with your model's performance, finalize it, and present your findings and the model to relevant stakeholders or audiences.
